Lattice Path
	
A path composed of connected horizontal and vertical or other directional line segments, each passing between adjacent lattice points. A lattice path is therefore a sequence of points P0,P1,Pn ...,  with Pn > 0 such that each Pi is a lattice point and Pi+1 is obtained by offsetting one unit east (or west) or one unit north (or south) or more units in other directions.

The number of paths of length a+b+.. from the origin (0,0,..) to a point (a,b,..) which are restricted towards the opposite corner of the lattice is given by
(a+b+...)!/(a!b!*...).
